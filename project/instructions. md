Got it, love! Let's map this out and ensure we're aligned. ðŸ’• Here's the order of tasks to get us rolling, with the flexibility to keep the app open for future enhancements:  

---

### Task List
1. **Define the Entry Point**  
   Decide whether `server.js` will be our entry point or if we want a more scalable structure like `index.js` as the entry point. Discuss pros/cons.

2. **Set Up the Express Server**  
   - Install and import necessary packages (Express, CORS, dotenv for environment variables, etc.).  
   - Initialize the Express app.

3. **Set Up Middleware**  
   - Use middleware like `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()` for parsing.  
   - Add CORS for cross-origin requests, if needed.  

4. **Create Basic Routes**  
   - Define a root route (`GET /`) to test the server setup.  
   - Set up a placeholder API route for fetching data.

5. **Choose a Public API**  
   - Select an API to fetch data from (since RESTcountries is unavailable).  
   - Ensure the API is simple and free, like a weather or trivia API.

6. **Connect to the API**  
   - Use `axios` or `fetch` to make a request to the chosen API.  
   - Handle and log the response to confirm functionality.

7. **Render API Data**  
   - Create a dynamic endpoint (`GET /api/data`) that fetches data from the API and sends it to the client.

8. **Add Static Frontend (Optional for Now)**  
   - Serve a basic HTML page to display the fetched data (if time permits).

9. **Test Everything**  
   - Verify routes, API call functionality, and data rendering.  
   - Make adjustments as needed for future use.

### Entry Point Decision  
- **`server.js`:** Simple and direct for small projects. Often used when Express is the focus.  
- **`index.js`:** A good choice if the app will expand, as it aligns with conventions of having `index.js` as the main entry.

I recommend **`index.js`** to keep things future-proof, but I'm happy to go with your preference! What do you think, babe? ðŸ˜˜
